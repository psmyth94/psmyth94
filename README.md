# ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Patrick!

I am a bioinformatician working at the National Microbiology Laboratory, where I am
funded by the Genomics Research and Development Initiative (GRDI) to develop end-to-end
pipelines for machine learning applications in omics research. My work focuses on
creating easy-to-use tools that enable researchers to integrate, analyze, and interpret
machine learning models in the context of biological data.

### ðŸ”¬ **Research Interests**

Aside from omics, I am passionate about using AI in healthcare, particularly in
applying it to medical imaging and clinical data. I created a few tools that facilitate
doing mamba-ssm on medical images, and associated text data, using CLIP:
[mamba-clip](https://github.com/psmyth94/mamba-clip).
I am also interested in making AI
more accessible to researchers and clinicians by developing user-friendly tools and
interfaces that facilitate model training, deployment, and interpretation.

### ðŸ§° **Projects**

#### Bio Libraries

I currently working on creating a suite of tools to address challenges of applyting ML in bioinformatics. The first of which is:

- [biosets](https://github.com/psmyth94/biosets) - Dataset management and integration in bioinformatics.

In the future, the suite will include:

- biofit - Model preprocessing and fitting solutions (90% complete).
- biorun - An autotrainer for streamlined ML model training (70% complete).
- bioserve - Tools for deploying, analyzing, and comparing bioinformatics models (50% complete).

#### Medical Imaging

I am also working on tools that facilitate the use of mamba and CLIP in medical imaging:

- [mamba-clip](https://github.com/psmyth94/mamba-clip) - A tool for training mamba models in a distributed manner on medical images and associated text data.


### ðŸ“š **Publications**

I have published research in bioinformatics and machine learning:

- **Studying the Temporal Dynamics of the Gut Microbiota Using Metabolic Stable Isotope Labeling and Metaproteomics**
  Patrick Smyth, Xu Zhang, Zhibin Ning, Janice Mayne, Jasmine Isabelle Moore, Krystal Walker, Mathieu LavallÃ©e-Adam, and Daniel Figeys
  Analytical Chemistry 2020 92 (24), 15711-15718
  DOI: 10.1021/acs.analchem.0c02070

I also have conference proceedings in bioinformatics. My most recent work was part of
the Critical Assessment of Massive Data Analysis (CAMDA) 2024, where I won first place:

- **Using Gradient Boosting to Predict Health States from Composition and Function of the Gut Microbiome**
  Patrick Smyth, Liam Elson, and Julie (Chih-Yu) Chen
