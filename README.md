# ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Patrick!

I currently working on creating a suite of tools to address challenges of applyting ML in bioinformatics:

- [biosets](https://github.com/psmyth94/biosets) - Dataset management and integration in bioinformatics (Released).
- biofit - Model preprocessing and fitting solutions (90% complete).
- biorun - An autotrainer for streamlined ML model training (70% complete).
- bioserve - Tools for deploying, analyzing, and comparing bioinformatics models (50% complete).

#### Medical Imaging

I am also working on tools that facilitate the use of mamba and CLIP in medical imaging:

- [mamba-clip](https://github.com/psmyth94/mamba-clip) - A tool for training mamba models in a distributed manner on medical images and associated text data.
