# ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Patrick!

I am currently working on creating a suite of tools to address challenges of applying ML in bioinformatics:

- [biosets](https://github.com/psmyth94/biosets) - Dataset management and integration in bioinformatics (Released).
- [biosets](https://github.com/psmyth94/biofit) - Model preprocessing and fitting solutions (Released).
- `biorun` - An autotrainer built on top of `biosets` and `biofit` (80% complete).
- `bioserve` - Tools for deploying, analyzing, and comparing bioinformatics models (50% complete).

#### Medical Imaging

I am also working on tools that facilitate the use of mamba and CLIP in medical imaging:

- [mamba-clip](https://github.com/psmyth94/mamba-clip) - A tool for training mamba models in a distributed manner on medical images and associated text data.

### ðŸ“« **Connect with Me**

For those interested in collaborating or discussing bioinformatics, machine learning, or
AI in healthcare, feel free to reach out to me. I also am looking for people to join
Kaggle competitions with, so if you are interested in that, let me know!
